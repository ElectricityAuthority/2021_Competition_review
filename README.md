# 2021_Competition_review

This includes some of the code and data (minus any confidential data) used to create charts and tables under the conduct section of the review paper, and the code to create the gross pivotal chart under the structure section (and the data that was output from the simulations in vSPD). More code and data for other charts and tables in the review paper can be added if requested (provided it is non-confidential data).
 
More code and data used to create the indicators used in the review for the structure, conduct, and performance framework (including input and output data from DOASA) is available at:

## DOASA data

All the input data used for DOASA is in the Archive subfolder together with the problem.csv.
 
The following are in the Simulation subfolder of each Simulation year case:
 
  - All the modelled output data
  - Recommended generation
  - Storage outcomes (forecast)
  - Thermal generation requirements
  - Price outcomes

Water values are in the WaterValues subfolder (treating all reservoirs as a single big reservoir where all individual reservoirs are equally full).
